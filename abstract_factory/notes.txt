Category: Creational Design pattern

Objective: To specify entire product families without specifying their concrete classes

Interface to create all the products but leaves the actual creation/ implementation of the product
to the concrete factory classes

Each factory corresponds to specific product types

Client code calls the implementation of the factory object instead. Each factory implements a specific
product to ensure compatabilities. 

This means that each Factory Class will handle the instantion of specific product type. The client code works
with the interface and so, it can handle multiple variants
